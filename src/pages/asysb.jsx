                A really inspirational quote, that got me thinking about where I am and where I want to be
                I thought about the challenges we face as humans, to <span>overcome our own weaknesses </span>
                to sacrifice and give in all that we can to become who want to become, to be who we are 
                meant to be.

                I am constantly asking if I should consider myself <span>ambitious or delusional. </span>

                version of ourselves, every decision we make should be in regards to that.

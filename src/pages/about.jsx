        <p>
                Welcome.My name is <span>Benjamin</span>. This is my
                own little journal to keep track of my steps on a million mile
                journey<span> with a million possible destinations.</span>
        </p>

            A long road ahead

                At the time of writing this, I'm an economics student but with deviant-like 
                attraction to computers. I originally wanted to opt for a computer science course.
                But, I had to settle for my second option, <span>Economics. </span>
                However, I still learn computer science
                science.
                At the time, I have learnt programming in python(fully certified), javaScript(self taught) and ofcourse html and css.
                I wish to <span>go beyond where I am now</span>, far, far beyond
        </p>

        <p className='main_text'>
                So why am I bothering myself, economics is hard enough already, 
                why add on
                computer science?
                The answer is simple and really cheesy, 
                I want to be something greater,
                something much more than what everyone around me expects me to be.
                I want to create amazing things, 
                I want to be a keystone in the 
                grand structure of humanity.
                I'm hoping that by learning to program,I can build software, that would <span>change lives</span><br></br>
                I want to be anything but your everyday human.

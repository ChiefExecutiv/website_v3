            <h1>What I want out of 2024</h1>
            <p className='main_text'>
                After spending a lot of time learning and jumping from field to field<span>I realised one 
                thing, I don't have a plan</span> Usually I would go around experimenting on things and topics
                that interest me. Though if I am to make it as far as I want to go, then I need a more
                systematic approach
                I want to prioritize learning to program a long with learning economics and then bridge 
                them together
            </p>
            <p className='main_text'>
                I recently came across this <a href='https://github.com/ossu/computer-science' className='link'>'open source computer science degree'</a><br></br>
                And I intend to follow as much of it as I can. No more 'tutorial hell'.
                It's claimed to have the equivalent of a 2 year bachelor's degree in computer science. 
                Then I will dive deeper into artificial intelligence, to test out an 
                <span> idea</span> I have for building predictive A.I and machine learning models, 
                to see how I/we can rely on this revolutionary
                technology to the best of mankind's interests.
                It's a long road ahead, let's see how it goes.

            "The problem of economics is 
            threefold: first, to obtain a reliable body of 
            knowledge about economic phenomena; second, to analyze 
            this knowledge in a systematic manner; and third, to make use of 
            that knowledge in such a way as to improve the material 
            conditions of human existence." - Paul Samuelson

            A land of diversity, thriving culture that 
            captivates all who observe it, the beauty of the land is a 
            testament of the works of God. A big little world forged through the 
            sands of time gifted and rich in culture, diversity, nature so much so 
            that one famous individual once referred to it as 
            the ‘Pearl of Africa’. Welcome to Uganda!!
            </p>

            It’s funny, the Uganda described by Winston Churchill, isn’t 
            the Uganda I experience, perhaps he viewed the country from the sky, 
            he saw mountains, hills, lakes, but he didn’t see the charred ground on 
            which many of its people sleep. I believe he didn’t describe what Uganda was, 
            he described what it could be, what it could accomplish.

            I walk the streets of Kampala every so often, I see people 
            struggling daily to make it to the next day, I see the beggars on the sidewalk, I
            see the homeless children, I see people I would only describe as desperate, 
            what I see is a civilization in need of saving. I particularly took up economics 
            because it studies people, it studies people’s 
            problems and most importantly, it offers solutions
            </p>

            <p className='main_text'>
            The scope of Uganda’s economy ofcourse just like all real world 
            phenomenon cannot be captured fully, it’s a complex web of intertwined 
            and interconnected events that are far too difficult to map precisely. So it c
            an only be abstracted, illustrated and represented. One misconception people 
            have is when asked, what is Uganda’s problem, the most recurring answer is ofcourse 
            corruption. While this answer does hold truth, politicians 
            have been corrupt all throughout ancient and modern history. We need more details.

            <h2>What is wrong with our country? </h2>

            <p className='main_text'>
            As implied this is strictly economics, not politics. 
            I am going to break it down into very simple blocks. So, 
            what is wrong with our country? As I said, a country’s economic 
            problems are too large to be mapped precisely, 
            so I am focusing on 4 major problems or sectors if you will.
            </p>

            <p className='main_text'>
            Uganda has:
            <ol>
                <li>Too many people in the informal sector</li>
                <li>An underdeveloped agricultural system</li>
                <li>A seriously lacking Manufacturing sector(Product quality is lacking)</li>
                <li>A fairly Unproductive population</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <span>Too many people in the informal sector !</span>
            <p className='main_text'>
                
                The informal sector refers to economic activities and 
                jobs that are not regulated by the government and are not 
                included in official statistics. It's the part of the economy 
                where people work and trade outside of formal rules and structures. 
                In Uganda’s case, mobile money kiosks, the traders in the capital city 
                downtown area, the motorcycle taxi 
                providers, taxis, street vendors and so on….
            </p>

            <p className='main_text'>
            <span>Why are they so many?</span>
            Question based research tells that a reason for starting 
            their business in the informal sector. Correspondingly, 50.7% 
            started their businesses for lack of employment opportunities in the 
            formal sector while 2.6% suggested the employment they had was not 
            satisfactory or at least not paying them what they expected.
            </p>

            <p className='main_text'>
            The consequence is that the informal sector 
            is not very rewarding, atleast to the vast  
            majority of individuals. It’s also not very rewarding to the country. 
            The informal sector can vaguely be described as  ‘chaotic’. It’s unregulated
            and unaccountable. Most tax evasions occur in this sector, most road accidents in 
            Uganda are caused by boda boda men, they are unregulated. Yet again , as sighted out, 
            if these individuals had a better option, maybe they would take that instead. 
            Or maybe the problem is, the people don’t know their options…
            <span>..Enter..the under developed agricultural system.</span>
            </p>

            <p className='main_text'>
            Did you know <span>Uganda is the 2nd largest producer of coffee in Africa</span>, and the 7th globally.
            </p>

            <p className='main_text'>
            Did you also know that <span>Uganda’s land has the potential to feed 200 
            million people.</span> No doubt agriculture is the backbone of Uganda’s economy and yet, 
            we are still poor , hungry and unemployed.
            </p>
            <h2>Where Uganda fails in agriculture</h2>
            <p className='main_text'>
            The agricultural sector is the biggest 
            employer but I can only describe it as wasted potential. 
            The coffee that we export is primarily unprocessed and of low value, 
            we export raw materials and not high value finished products. 
            Many of the countries farmers rely on primitive production methods and yield low quality output.
             A lot of produce is food stuffs such as matooke that is consumed locally but has a 
             very small place on the world market. What the agricultural sector needs is a complete revolution 
             from the ground, upwards and to the middle out. We need to produce high value crops 
             that other countries would want to buy by the dozens. And we need to turn much of our 
             raw agricultural produce into high quality finished products,
             however we can’t do that until we  deal with….
            </p>

            <h2>….the severely lacking manufacturing sector</h2>

            <p className='main_text'>
            Manufacturing in Uganda consists predominantly 
            of last‑stage (end‑product) assembly and raw materials processing, a 
            high share of which is food processing. Both of these are low value‑added activities. 
            Agri‑processing firms account for about 39% of manufacturing establishments in Uganda. 
            A substantial investment in capital and infrastructure is required to raise the value of 
            Uganda’s manufactured output. Doing so would expand our industries, provide backward linkages 
            to the lagging agricultural sector, support many individuals, offering them 
            employment mostly which is low barrier to entry.
            </p>

            <p className='main_text'>
            And the final issue, the unproductive population. I believe that a 
            country develops with its people. ‘Uganda’s Human Capital Index is low. 
            Children born in Uganda today are likely to be 38% as productive when they 
            grow up as they could be if they enjoyed complete education and full health. 
            Children who start schooling at the age of four years are only expected to complete 
            6.8 years of school by their 18th birthday, compared to the Sub-Saharan average of 8.3. 
            However, a child’s actual years of learning are 4.3, with 2.5 years considered “wasted” 
            due to the poor quality of education.(citation). Simply put, the country is the people, 
            <span>develop the people and you will develop the country.</span>
            </p>

            <span>
            Uganda is an amazing country, filled with opportunity, 
            potential for greatness. We just need the right mindset, 
            the right self governance to turn it into the utopia it should be.
            The power to change our lives is within us and no one else. The destination is clear, 
            the path to take is what we should focus on

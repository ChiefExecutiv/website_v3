        <h1>2023 year in review</h1>
        <p>By far one of the <span className='txtDcr'>most eventful years of my life</span></p>
        <p>- My first year out of highschool<br></br>
        - My first year in university<br></br>
        - My first year learning to code<br></br>
        </p>

        <p>Most importantly, it's the year where I've been lost<br></br>
        For the first time in my life, I don't know where I want to be<br></br>
        I don't know where to go<br></br>
        Coding has been mostly fun, but after learning the basics, <span className='txtDcr'>what then?</span><br></br>
        So I asked myself why I want to code<br></br>
        If I could have asked my self 5 years ago,<br></br> I would have said something like<rb></rb>
        "To make videogames <br></br>or to hack the pentagon"<br></br>
        I have a different answer now
        <span className='txtDcr'>"To reshape the world"</span>
        </p>

        <p>So this year has been one of learning and experience<br></br>
            One of <span className='txtDcr'>mistakes, helplessness, one of pain and gain</span><br></br>
            But in the end 2023 I believe defines the path I take<br></br>
            for years to come, <br></br>it has been a <span className='txtDcr'>wonderful year</span>
        </p>

            <h1>What I want out of 2024</h1>
            <p>
                My major goal this year is to <span className="txtDcr">learn and go much deeper</span><br></br>
                I want to focus less on learning programming languages and more on learning to
                program. <br></br>To make scalable and high quality software<br></br>
                I recently came across this <a href='https://github.com/ossu/computer-science' className='link'>'open source computer science degree'</a><br></br>
                And I intend to follow it from beginning to end. No more 'tutorial hell'. <br></br>
                Then besides or after that, <br></br>I will dive deeper into artificial intelligence, <br></br>to test out an 
                <span className="txtDcr"> idea</span> I have for building predictive A.I models, <br></br>
                to see how I/we can rely on this revolutionary
                technology to the best of mankind's interests.<br></br>
                It's a long road ahead, let's see how it goes.
